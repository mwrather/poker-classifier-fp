# Learn Functional Programming in Javascript

This repository gives code samples illustrating how to refactor a small program using functional principles and the [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) JavaScript library.

## System Requirements

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)
- [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org/)
- [`npm`](https://npmjs.com/)

## Setup

Clone this repo and install dependencies.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mwrather/poker-classifier-fp.git
cd poker-classifier-fp
npm install
```

Checkout

```shell
git checkout start         # the bare repo with no tests
git checkout conventional  # pass tests with a conventional approach
git checkout fp            # refactor using ramda
```

## Working

As you experiment with different implementations, use the tests to check your work:

```shell
npm run test        # test the implementation once
npm run test:watch  # re-run tests on file save
```
